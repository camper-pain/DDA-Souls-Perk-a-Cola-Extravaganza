Just a simple mod adding a number of different drinks styled after the COD Zombies Perk-A-Colas with various effects. 

So far, 8/11 Colas have been implemented. They have a chance to be found inside of drinks vending machines and bought for old world money (or smash and grabbed, if you're a psychopath).

Implemented so far:
  - Stamin-Up - 500% Stamina Regeneration for 7 Days
  - Deadshot Daiquiri - 2/3rds reduction in base weapon dispersion for 72 Hours
  - Amm-O-Matic - Spawns a box of random civilian and military ammunition at your feet
  - Tufbrew - +10 Armor bash/cut/stab/bullet/acid/electric for 72 hours
  - Juggernog - 250% Base Body Part Health and 50% incoming pain for 48 hours
  - Death Perception - 15 tiles of Enemy Detection for 48 hours
  - Quick Revive - Massive Health Regen for 24 hours
  - Double Tap - 2x Attack Speed and 50% Recoil for 72 hours
